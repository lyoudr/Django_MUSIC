    text: The game is a spin-off from the Drakengard series, and follows the fifth
      ending of the first game, the events of which have left the planet Earth in
      a state of decay. Set over one thousand years after this, the game puts the
      player in control of the protagonist as he attempts to find a cure for an illness,
      known as the Black Scrawl, to which Yonah—either his sister or daughter, depending
      on the version—has succumbed. Partnering with a talking book known as Grimoire
      Weiss, he journeys with two other characters, Kainé and Emil, as he attempts
      to find a remedy and understand the nature of the creatures known as Shades
      that stalk the world. The gameplay borrows elements from various video game
      genres, occasionally switching between them and the main role-playing-based
      gameplay.

    text: The plot of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three walls,
      the last location where humans still live. Over one hundred years ago, humanity
      was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants
      called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. The last remnants of humanity
      retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed nearly a century of peace.
      To combat Titans, the nation's military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment,
      a set of waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling immense
      mobility in three dimensions.
